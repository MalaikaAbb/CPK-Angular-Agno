/**
 * A2UI — a guided read of the guide itself, because the guide is the defect.
 *
 * https://docs.copilotkit.ai/angular/agno/guides/a2ui
 *
 * `a2ui: {}` in frontend/server.ts turns the middleware on and `/info` duly
 * reports `a2uiEnabled: true`, but supplying `a2ui.catalog` is what actually
 * registers the `render_a2ui` renderer — and the guide's catalog snippets are
 * not self-contained. `a2uiConfigForFeature` returns four catalogs
 * (`beautifulCatalog`, `declarativeCatalog`, `fixedCatalog`) and `app.config.ts`
 * hands `productCatalog` to `provideCopilotKit`; the page defines none of them,
 * and the props in `fixedDefinitions` are built out of a `dynamicString` that
 * never appears either. Nothing a reader copies out of this guide will render.
 *
 * So this recording is not a chat demo. It is one continuous descent to the
 * `a2uiConfigForFeature` snippet, a selection dragged across the four returns,
 * then across the individual identifiers. A voiceover is muxed over it by
 * `ci/lib/mux.mjs`; the holds below are the script's beats, kept short on
 * purpose — earlier cuts lingered and read as a stall rather than a point.
 *
 * Before any of that, the take stops on the harness's own /a2ui notes route,
 * marks the reconstructed `a2uiConfigForFeature` block and writes down that the
 * guide never declares the catalogs it returns, so that code was written here.
 * See actions/catalog-code.ts.
 *
 * The prompt in `pages.config.ts` is deliberately not sent any more: asking the
 * agent produced a paragraph of prose, which showed the symptom but not the
 * cause. The cause is on this page and can be pointed at.
