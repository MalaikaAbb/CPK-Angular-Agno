## 2. Overview

[Agno](https://docs.agno.com) is a Python agent framework. Its `AgentOS` server can expose an agent over [AG-UI](https://ag-ui.com), the event protocol CopilotKit speaks. `@copilotkit/angular` is the first-party, signal-based Angular frontend for AG-UI agents, and it supports zoneless applications.

This repo is a **living test harness** for that pairing. Each route implements what its guide teaches — not a restatement of it. Every line of CopilotKit code in `frontend/src/app/features/` is taken from the live docs; where a doc snippet is not self-contained, it is displayed on the route page as a quoted sample and explicitly *not* mounted, rather than being completed with invented code.

Tracks: **<https://docs.copilotkit.ai/angular/agno>**

Scope is the eight pages named at build time (the quickstart plus the seven task guides), plus two added later: Sub-agents and AG-UI. The last guide covers four topics at once and is split into four routes here.

---

## 3. Architecture

```
Browser (Angular 22, zoneless)
  │  @copilotkit/angular — provideCopilotKit, <copilot-chat>, signal APIs
  │  POST http://localhost:8210/api/copilotkit
  ▼
Copilot Runtime  ·  localhost:8210        ← Node, frontend/server.ts
  │  agents: { default, support, research-agent } → new AgnoAgent({ url })
  │          { subagents }                         → …/subagents/agui
  │  a2ui: {}  → A2UIMiddleware
  │  POST http://localhost:8211/agui            ← AG-UI over SSE
  │  POST http://localhost:8211/subagents/agui  ← Sub-agents supervisor
  ▼
Agno AgentOS  ·  localhost:8211           ← Python / FastAPI
  │  AgentOS(agents=[agent, subagents_supervisor],
  │          interfaces=[AGUI(agent=agent), AGUI(agent=subagents_supervisor, prefix="/subagents")])
  ▼

```

Three points worth noting:

- **Three processes, not two.** Unlike the React/Next quickstart — where the runtime lives inside the Next app as an API route — Angular has no server route to host it, so the Copilot Runtime is its own Node process. This is the single biggest structural difference from the React version of this harness.
- **The backend for this framework is Python.** Agno is a Python library; the agent runs under `uvicorn`, not Node.
- **The model key never reaches the browser**, and never reaches the runtime either. Only the Agno process holds it.

**Why four agent ids.** `default`, `support` and `research-agent` all resolve to the same Agno agent. `default` is the id CopilotKit's prebuilt components use with no configuration. `support` and `research-agent` are aliases, so the Chat UI and Threads guides (`agentId="support"`) and the AG-UI page (`injectAgentStore("research-agent")`) run exactly as published. `subagents` is a different agent: the Sub-agents supervisor, served by the same Agno process at `/subagents/agui`.

---

## 4. Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js | 22+ (built on 24.16.0) | The Angular quickstart specifies Node 22. |
| npm | 10+ (built on 12.0.1) | Or pnpm/yarn. |
| Angular CLI | 20, 21, or 22 (built on 22.1.3) | `@copilotkit/angular` supports these three majors only. |
| Python | 3.13+ (built on 3.13.13) | Per `backend/.python-version`. |
| [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) | 0.11+ (built on 0.11.20) | Used for the backend. `pip` works too. |
| OpenAI API key | — | Required. |
| CopilotKit license key | — | **Optional.** Only affects the Threads and Memory routes. |

`@angular/cdk` must share your Angular major version. If you hit a peer-dependency error, pin it explicitly (`@angular/cdk@^22` on Angular 22).

---

## 5. Setup

**1. Clone**

```bash
git clone <this-repo> agno && cd agno
```

**2. Install frontend deps**

```bash
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
```

**3. Install backend deps**

```bash
cd backend && uv sync && cd ..
```

**4. Configure the environment**

```bash
cp .env.example backend/.env
```

Then edit `backend/.env`:

| Variable | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `backend/.env` | **Required.** The model key. |
| `AGNO_AGENT_URL` | shell for the runtime | Where the runtime finds the agent. Defaults to `http://localhost:8211/agui`. |
| `PORT` | shell for the runtime | Runtime port. Defaults to `8210`. |
| `COPILOTKIT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` | shell for the runtime | Opt out of anonymous runtime telemetry. |

> The Angular app's `runtimeUrl` is hardcoded to `http://localhost:8210/api/copilotkit` in `frontend/src/app/app.config.ts`, following the quickstart. If you change `PORT`, change that too.

**5. Update to latest packages (optional)**

Check before you bump. `npm outdated` is read-only, and anything it lists is one
of only three things, of which just one is actionable:

```bash
npm --prefix frontend outdated
```

| Cause | Do |
|---|---|
| Our range is behind | Bump it, on a branch — below |
| An upstream package **exact-pins** an older version | Nothing. Report it upstream |
| A **peerDependency** forbids the newer one | Nothing. Bumping breaks the build |

`@copilotkit/angular` exact-pins `@copilotkit/core@1.66.0`, and Angular 22
requires `typescript >=6.0 <6.1` — so TypeScript reads a full major behind and
must stay there.

**Frontend:**
```bash
git checkout -b chore/bump-<package>
npm --prefix frontend install <package>@<version>
git diff frontend/package-lock.json   # one bump can drag in dozens of transitives
npm --prefix frontend run build
```

Then record the affected pages before merging — verifying the docs still run is
what this repo is for. Revert with
`git checkout frontend/package-lock.json && npm ci`.

Note that `@ag-ui/agno` is declared `^0.0.5`, and a caret on a `0.0.x` package
allows *only* that version. It cannot move on its own; it needs the hand edit
above.

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
uv lock --upgrade
uv sync
cd ..
```

Not `npx npm-check-updates -u`: it rewrites `package.json` to the newest release
of everything, ignoring the declared ranges, and walks straight into the peer
conflict above. Not `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` either — it does not fix a
peer conflict, it hides one, silencing the exact signal this harness reports on.

**Default ports:** frontend **4210**, runtime **8210**, agent **8211**.

---

## 6. Running the project

Three processes. The two Node ones share a terminal; the Python agent gets its own.

**Terminal 1 — the agent:**

```bash
cd backend
uv run main.py
```

Success looks like:

```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://localhost:8211 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

**Terminal 2 — the runtime and the app together:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

`dev` runs the Copilot Runtime and `ng serve` side by side under `concurrently`, with each line prefixed by which process wrote it. Success looks like:

```
[runtime] Copilot Runtime listening at http://localhost:8210/api/copilotkit
[runtime] Agno agent: http://localhost:8211/agui
[angular]   ➜  Local:   http://localhost:4210/
```

Ctrl-C stops both. `--kill-others` means a crash in either one takes the other down rather than leaving half a stack running — if the runtime dies you'll see `Sending SIGTERM to other processes..` and the app exits too, instead of a chat that silently can't reach anything.

To run them separately — different terminals, independent restarts — the underlying scripts are still there:

```bash
npm run runtime   # Copilot Runtime only, :8210
npm start         # Angular dev server only, :4210
```

Open **<http://localhost:4210>**. The Introduction route probes both backends and shows a connection panel — check it first if anything misbehaves.

The one-command check the quickstart prescribes:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8210/api/copilotkit/info
```

It should list `default`, `support`, `research-agent` and `subagents` under `agents`.

The CLI check the [CLI page](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/angular/agno/cli) added on 30 Aug, wired to this repo's port:

```bash
npm run verify              # wiring only
npm run verify:round-trip   # also runs the agent once — costs a model call
```

With the runtime up and no license key, the honest result here is **2 passed, 2 failed, 3 could not be checked** — the two failures are the hosted-project and API-key checks, which no unlicensed local setup can pass. See Known issues #12 before relying on `verify` as a pass/fail check.

---

## 7. What to expect — walkthrough per section

Every route shows a status badge and a link to the doc page it tests.

### How each route is split

Routes with a live feature are split in two, following the reference harness:

| | |
|---|---|
| **`<route>`** | Notes, pass/fail criteria, and **the exact source** of the implementation. No live chat here. |
| **`<route>/demo`** | Just the running feature, with no sidebar or page chrome — built for screen recording. Reached via **Open demo ↗** in the route header. |

Two consequences worth knowing:

- **The code on a page is never a re-typed approximation.** `scripts/generate-sources.ts` reads the real files off disk at build time into `src/app/lib/generated-sources.ts`, so what you compare against the doc is what actually runs. Angular's esbuild pipeline has no `?raw` import, which is why this is a prestart/prebuild step rather than an import.
- **Demo routes share the app-root provider**, so a conversation started in one demo continues in another. That's deliberate — Quickstart, Frontend tools, A2UI, and Headless all drive the `default` agent and show the *same* conversation through four different interfaces.

### Getting Started

**`/` — Introduction**
Orientation plus a live connection check of both backends. **Pass:** two green dots, `200` from the runtime's `/info` and the agent's `/status`. **Fail:** a red dot — that process isn't running.

**`/quickstart` — Quickstart**
The minimum viable path: an `AgnoAgent` in the runtime, `provideCopilotKit`, one `<copilot-chat>`. **Try:** `Can you tell me a joke?` **Pass:** tokens stream in one at a time and render as markdown. **Fail:** nothing streams.

### Guides

**`/chat-ui` — Chat UI and customization**
Three surfaces in tabs — only one mounts at a time, since the popup and docked sidebar both use fixed positioning. **Try:** `What is CopilotKit?`, then switch tabs. **Pass:** the inline chat shows the guide's blue user bubbles and pale-blue assistant bubbles; the custom-message tab renders replies through a hand-written component labelled "Assistant"; the popup and sidebar open, trap focus, and close on Escape. **Fail:** a surface renders blank, or all tabs look identical.

**`/frontend-tools-generative-ui` — Frontend tools and generative UI**
A server-side tool call rendered by an Angular component. **Try:** `What's the weather in Tokyo?` **Pass:** the call renders through `WeatherCardComponent` — "Loading weather for Tokyo", then the city in bold with the result beneath. **Fail:** a plain-text answer with no card, meaning the renderer name and the agent's tool name have drifted apart. **Also:** the guide now leads with a third path, `registerComponent` (display-only, no handler, nothing on the agent side). **Try:** `Show me incident INC-4711, severity sev1.` **Pass:** the card renders — and the agent then apologises for it in the next message, which is the finding. The route is ⚠️ Partial. See Known issues #19.

**`/a2ui` — A2UI schemas, styling, and recovery**
Declarative generative UI. **Try:** `Show me a card comparing two flight options.` **Pass:** a rendered declarative surface appears in the chat. **Currently observed:** prose instead — see Known issues #2. **Fail (different failure):** raw JSON or protocol operations printed as text.

**`/voice-multimodal` — Voice and multimodal input**
**Try:** attach a PNG or PDF via the picker, drag-and-drop, and paste; then press the microphone. **Pass (attachments):** files are accepted and sent as content parts; a file over 10 MiB is rejected. **Pass (voice):** the browser asks for microphone permission and records. **Expected failure (voice):** transcription then fails — this runtime reports `audioFileTranscriptionEnabled: false`, and the guide is explicit that a visible microphone does not make an unavailable transcription service succeed.

**`/human-in-the-loop` — Human-in-the-loop and interrupts**
**Try:** `Delete my account, but ask me to approve it first.` **Pass:** an Approve / Reject card renders in the message stream and **nothing further streams until you click**. After clicking, the run resumes with your decision. **Fail:** two options as plain text, or the agent continues without waiting. The interrupt controller is also mounted but stays idle — this Agno agent emits no AG-UI interrupts.

**`/shared-state` — Shared state and agent context**
**Try:** press **Mark high priority**, then ask `What is my current priority?`; press **Use London time**, then ask `What timezone am I in, and which record am I looking at?` **Pass:** the agent reports `high`, then `Europe/London` and `record-42`; asking it to add a note updates the list on the left. **Fail:** the agent has no idea what you're referring to.

### Threads, memory, attachments, headless

These four routes all come from the single `threads-memory-attachments-headless` guide.

**`/threads` — Threads.** **Pass (unlicensed — the case here):** the headless list renders its controls with no threads, and the drawer renders its *locked* state. That locked state is the correct result: it proves the drawer mounted and read the platform's `threads` license feature. **Pass (licensed):** threads list and selecting a row replays that conversation. **Fail:** a blank area with no locked state.

**`/memory` — Memory.** **Pass (this runtime):** "Memory is not available for this runtime." — the `isAvailable()` gate resolved false and the guide's fallback rendered, which is the whole point of the sample. **Fail:** an empty panel with neither list nor fallback, or a thrown error.

**`/attachments` — Attachments.** **Try:** add a file via picker, drag-and-drop, and paste. **Pass:** all three paths work, a file over 10 MiB is rejected, and a failed upload logs its `reason` and `message` through `onUploadFailed`. **Fail:** drag-and-drop or paste does nothing.

**`/headless` — Headless UI.** **Try:** type into the bare textarea and press Send. **Pass:** the message appears in the hand-written transcript, "Agent is working…" shows during the run, and the reply streams — with no CopilotKit chrome anywhere. A conversation started on Quickstart is already visible here. **Fail:** Send does nothing.

### Inspector

**`/inspector` — Inspector.** **Try:** open the demo and look at the bottom-left corner, then open **Agents → Agent** and send a message with **AG-UI Events** open. **Pass:** the badge reads `cpk-web-inspector mounted`, the launcher sits bottom-left (the page's CSS override), the agent is listed, and events move while the reply streams. **Fail:** no launcher, or the badge stays on `no cpk-web-inspector`. Nothing in the demo component mounts the element — that is the claim under test.

### Agent capabilities

**`/multi-agent/subagents` — Sub-agents**
A supervisor Agno agent hands work to research, writing and critique sub-agents through tool calls, and records each hand-off in shared state. **Try:** `Write a short paragraph about the history of the bicycle.` **Pass:** Researcher, Writer and Critic cards appear in the chat in turn, each going from "Working" to "Complete". Each one joins the delegation log on the left once it completes, and the log's role pills light up. **Fail:** the supervisor answers alone with no cards, or the cards complete but the log stays at `0 calls`, meaning state isn't reaching the browser.

### Backend

**`/ag-ui` — AG-UI**
Reads an agent's messages and run status through `injectAgentStore`, and subscribes to its raw AG-UI events. **Try:** open the browser console, then ask `What's the weather in Tokyo?` **Pass:** the message count rises, "Agent is running…" shows during the run, and the console logs `Streaming text:`, `Tool called: getWeather` and `State changed:`. **Fail:** the count stays at 0 and nothing is logged, meaning `research-agent` didn't resolve.

**`/status`** — Every route and its status in one table.

## 8. Testing checklist / current status

Verified 2026-08-12 against a live stack (real OpenAI key, no license key).

| Doc page | Route | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/angular/agno` | `/` | 📖 Reference | Landing page + live probe of both backends. |
| `/angular/agno/quickstart` | `/quickstart` | ✅ Working | Verified end-to-end: streamed reply from gpt-4o. |
| `/angular/agno/guides/chat-ui` | `/chat-ui` | ✅ Working | All four surfaces; three mounted, `CopilotChatView` referenced only. |
| `/angular/agno/guides/frontend-tools-generative-ui` | `/frontend-tools-generative-ui` | ⚠️ Partial | `registerRenderToolCall` verified over the wire: `getWeather` called with `{"city":"Tokyo"}`. The guide’s new first section, `registerComponent`, is mounted and runs on `^0.5.1`, and its published snippet is wrong four ways — Known issues #19. `registerFrontendTool` samples shown, not mounted — see Known issues #4. |
| `/angular/agno/guides/a2ui` | `/a2ui` | ⚠️ Partial | Inert without a frontend catalog — that, not the runtime middleware, is the switch. See Known issues #2. |
| `/angular/agno/guides/voice-multimodal` | `/voice-multimodal` | ⚠️ Partial | Attachments work. Transcription unavailable by design — `audioFileTranscriptionEnabled: false`. |
| `/angular/agno/guides/human-in-the-loop` | `/human-in-the-loop` | ⚠️ Partial | Works when the model chooses to ask: `requestApproval` emitted with **no** tool result, run pauses awaiting the browser. The model often answers without asking — Known issues #28. Interrupt half idle — agent emits none. |
| `/angular/agno/guides/shared-state` | `/shared-state` | ✅ Working | Round-trip verified across two written values, with a harness-only diagnostics strip logging every `store().state()` transition. Agent state starts `{}` and loses `notes` on first write — Known issues #16. |
| `/angular/agno/guides/threads-…-headless` | `/threads` | ⚠️ Partial | Premium. `/info` reported `threadEndpoints.mutations: false` on runtime 1.70.1; on 1.73.3 (2026-09-23) it reports `list`, `inspect`, `mutations` and `realtimeMetadata` all `true`. Not re-recorded since the upgrade. |
| `/angular/agno/guides/threads-…-headless` | `/memory` | ⚠️ Partial | Premium; runtime provides no memory routes, so the fallback renders. |
| `/angular/agno/guides/threads-…-headless` | `/attachments` | ✅ Working | Picker, drag-and-drop, paste. |
| `/angular/agno/guides/threads-…-headless` | `/headless` | ✅ Working | Shares the `default` conversation with the other demos. |
| `/angular/agno/inspector` | `/inspector` | ✅ Working | Verified live: element mounts, panel opens, System Health *Healthy*, `RUN_FINISHED` in Recent activity after a real run. Not reproducible on 0.3.1 — Known issues #12; launcher position caveat #15. The manifest carried no `routes` for this page until 2026-09-21, so the live `/inspector` route counted as untracked and the page as unrouted. Both now point at each other. |
| `/angular/agno/cli` | — | 🚧 Not started | No route. The new `verify` section is exercised through `npm run verify` instead; findings in Known issues #12. |
| `/angular/agno/intelligence/memories` | `/memory` | ⚠️ Partial | The page's Angular path is `injectMemories()`, which `/memory` already mounts. Premium; recording stopped (`756ec4b`). |
| `/angular/agno/intelligence/learned-skills` | — | ❌ Broken | No Agno adapter, and every Python package it names is 404 on PyPI — Known issues #26. The 2026-09-21 sync added a BuiltInAgent row and two BuiltInAgent snippets: `learnedSkills` does not exist on `BuiltInAgent` in the declared `@copilotkit/runtime` 1.70.1, and the factory sample imports `ai` and `@ai-sdk/openai`, which the page never tells you to install (#33, #34). The `learnedSkills` half is resolved at 1.73.3, which this repo now declares. The 2026-09-23 sync uncommented a placeholder revision pin in every example (#40) and its Reuse-client sample sets `apiUrl` without `wsUrl` (#39). |
| `/angular/agno/learning` | — | ⚠️ Partial | `getLearningContainerId` typechecks on runtime 1.72.0; the snippet's `agents` and `identifyUser` are undefined — #27. Needs a dashboard-created container. The 2026-09-21 sync added the daily-schedule and skill-delivery steps; its adapter list contradicts the learned-skills table it links to (#34). |
| `/angular/agno/copilot-runtime` | — | 📖 Reference | Near-duplicate of `backend/copilot-runtime`. Both gained the same "Which name identifies an agent" section on 2026-09-21 (#29), and one more Next.js-titled snippet each (#24). |
| `/angular/agno/backend/copilot-runtime` | — | 📖 Reference | `server.ts` already follows it (`a2ui: {}`, `intelligence`, `identifyUser`), and registers two agent-map keys (`default`, `support`), which is what the new agent-naming section teaches. Its `CopilotKitAgentDiscoveryError` is not what the Angular surface throws (#29). The new `sseKeepAliveIntervalSeconds` option is absent from the declared runtime (#30). |
| `/angular/agno/backend/agent-runner` | — | 📖 Reference | All five TS snippets compile verbatim on 1.72.0; `runner` + `intelligence` is a type error and throws the quoted message, as documented. `server.ts` sets no runner, but it does pass `intelligence`, and a `CopilotIntelligenceRuntime` constructs an `IntelligenceAgentRunner` for you (read in 1.70.1's `runtime.mjs`), so the in-memory half of the unauthorized-thread-routes callout added on 2026-09-21 is not this harness. What applies here is its last sentence: `threads/events`, `threads/state` and `agent/stop` read the thread by id alone even on the platform, and `server.ts` guards none of them. Its cross-links point at an Auth section that does not exist (#31), and its 422 claim is reported under a different cause (#32). |
| `/angular/agno/backend/runtime-endpoints` | — | ⚠️ Partial | `/info` and `inspector-metadata` (200, `no-store, private`, V1 body) probed and match. `/run` on this Intelligence runtime returns JSON, not the SSE the table promises — #25. The new thread-routes table matches `RouteInfo` in 1.70.1 exactly; its `onBeforeHandler` sample uses two identifiers nothing in the section defines (#31, #32). |
| `/angular/agno/backend/ag-ui` | — | 📖 Reference | Tracked; no code to run. |
| `/angular/agno/backend/custom-agent` | — | 📖 Reference | Tracked. Links to a dead page — #23. Its factory-context interface was renamed to `BuiltInAgentFactoryContext` with a `learnedSkills` field on 2026-09-21; neither exists in the declared runtime range (#33). |
| `/angular/agno/backend/self-managed-agents` | — | 📖 Reference | Tracked. |
| `/angular/agno/agentic-protocols/ag-ui` | — | 📖 Reference | Concept page, no code. |
| `/angular/agno/runtime-server-adapter` | — | 📖 Reference | `server.ts` is its "Node.js HTTP" shape (`createCopilotNodeListener`). |
| `/angular/agno/deploy/agentcore` | — | 📖 Reference | AWS deployment; not testable locally. Links to a dead page — #23. |
| `/angular/agno/troubleshooting/debug-mode` | — | ⚠️ Partial | `debug` defaults table matches 1.72.0 exactly. On this Intelligence runtime `debug: true` logged only `Agent run started` — #25. |
| `/angular/agno/troubleshooting/event-inspector` | — | ⚠️ Partial | The claims probed on 2026-09-18 all held: root path 404s with `{"error":"Not found"}`, basePath answers `: connected`, and the stream stays empty on an Intelligence run, as its warning says. The 2026-09-21 rewrite replaced the gate it documents, and the declared runtime implements the old one, so the page's central safety claim is false here (#35). |
| `/angular/agno/telemetry` | — | 📖 Reference | No route. The 2026-09-21 change is two sentences of prose separating `CPK_INTELLIGENCE_API_KEY` from telemetry identity; consistent with `server.ts`, which uses that key for Intelligence only. |
| `/angular/agno/intelligence/overview` | — | 📖 Reference | No route. Rewritten on 2026-09-23 (110 lines to 44): the feature table whose automatic-learning cell changed on 2026-09-21 is gone, as is its "Go to **Automatic Learning**" step (#37). Nothing in the harness quotes it. |
| `/angular/agno/vs-code-extension` | — | 📖 Reference | Editor extension; tracked. |
| `/angular/agno/contributing/code-contributions/package-linking` | — | 📖 Reference | Contributor setup. |
| `/angular/agno/multi-agent/subagents` | `/multi-agent/subagents` | 🚧 Not started | Backend verified over the wire 2026-10-08: all three sub-agents called; `STATE_SNAPSHOT` carries three `completed` delegations. Browser rendering not yet verified. |
| `/angular/agno/ag-ui` | `/ag-ui` | 🚧 Not started | Runtime `/info` lists `research-agent`. Browser rendering and console output not yet verified. |

## 9. Automated Screen Recording Pipeline

Screen recording lives in [`autorecorder/`](autorecorder/) — a portable
Playwright suite shared across the CopilotKit framework repos and adapted to this
one. It produces one 1080p `.webm` per doc page: read the doc, switch to a
simulated VS Code and show the code that implements it, switch back to the
browser and drive the live feature.

> The older [`autorecord/`](autorecord/) folder is the **legacy** recorder kept
> for reference only. It is not maintained; everything below refers to
> `autorecorder/`.

### Standard 3-step walkthrough per page
1. **Doc page** (`https://docs.copilotkit.ai/angular/agno/...`) — smooth scrolling
   at reading cadence, cursor resting on a code block.
2. **Project code** — a VS Code Dark+ simulator rendering this repo's own source
   from disk, Shiki-highlighted, with the page's line range selected. Multi-file
   pages switch tabs.
3. **Live demo** (`/<page>/demo`) — the chrome-free demo surface, driven with a
   visible cursor: prompts typed key by key, token-stream completion detection,
   tool cards, approval clicks, attachment uploads, tab switches, and a Windows 11
   Notepad window for pages whose finding is a limitation rather than a feature.

### How to run

The backend (`:8211`), the Copilot Runtime (`:8210`) and the Angular dev server
(`:4210`) must all be up — the recorder refuses to start otherwise.

```bash
cd backend  && uv run main.py     # :8211
cd frontend && npm run dev        # runtime :8210 + ng serve :4210
```

Then:

```bash
cd autorecorder
npm install
npx playwright install chromium

npm run doctor              # is the configuration sane? exits non-zero if not

### Output

`autorecorder/videos/AGNO-angular-<NN>-<FeatureName>.webm`, 1920x1080.

`videos/` is **gitignored** — recordings are build output. What is committed is
`videos/manifest.json` and `videos/MANIFEST.md`, which record each clip's hash,
the source files it shows, and whether it has gone stale against them.

Three pages record a documented limitation rather than a working feature and say
so on screen: `a2ui` (the guide's catalog snippets are not self-contained),
`voice-multimodal` (no transcription service configured) and `threads` (licensed
endpoints, unlicensed runtime). See
[`autorecorder/README.md`](autorecorder/README.md) for the full scope table and
[`autorecorder/ADAPT.md`](autorecorder/ADAPT.md) for the porting contract.

## 10. Known issues / doc-vs-implementation discrepancies

Moved to [FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md).

## 11. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Chat sends, nothing streams back | Runtime or Agno process down | Check the Introduction route's connection panel; `curl http://localhost:8210/api/copilotkit/info`. |
| `/info` returns nothing | Runtime not started | `npm run runtime` from `frontend/`. |
| A run starts, then hangs forever | The agent called a browser tool with no registered handler, so no result ever returns | Every tool the agent can call must have a matching `registerFrontendTool` / `registerHumanInTheLoop` mounted. |
| Tool runs but the custom card doesn't render | Renderer name ≠ tool name | `registerRenderToolCall({ name })` must equal the Agno tool name exactly, including case. |
| Chat renders unstyled | Missing stylesheet | `@import "@copilotkit/angular/styles.css";` must be in `src/styles.css`. |
| CORS errors from the browser | Runtime CORS off | Keep `cors: true` in `createCopilotNodeListener`. The Agno process separately allows `localhost:4210` via `cors_allowed_origins`. |
| Connection errors mentioning `localhost` | DNS resolving to IPv6 while the server binds IPv4 | Use `127.0.0.1` in `AGNO_AGENT_URL`. |
| Production build fails on size | CopilotKit pulls in markdown and syntax-highlighting deps | Already raised in `angular.json`; see Known issues #9. |
| Peer-dependency error on install | `@angular/cdk` major mismatch | Install the matching major, e.g. `@angular/cdk@^22` on Angular 22. |
| Thread list empty, drawer shows a lock | No license key | Expected — not a bug. |
| "Use London time" looks dead — nothing changes | It writes context, not agent state, so no state transition is logged | Expected. Watch the *Registered context* column of the diagnostics strip: the entry moves to the end of the list with the new value. Known issues #18. |
| Source panels say "Source not generated" | Generated map is stale | `npm run gen:sources` (runs automatically on `npm start` / `npm run build`). |
| No Inspector launcher on `/inspector/demo` | `@copilotkit/angular` older than 0.4.0, or `enableInspector: false` | Bump to `^0.4.0`; the option lives on `provideCopilotKit` in `src/app/app.config.ts`. |
| Inspector disappears after navigating | A hand-written `WebInspector` component still in the app | Delete it — its `DestroyRef.onDestroy` removes the element the framework drives. This repo never had one. |
| `npm run verify` exits 1 on a working stack | Its three Intelligence checks FAIL without a license | Expected here; read the individual checks, not the summary. Known issues #13. |
| Backend exits immediately | No `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `cp .env.example backend/.env` and fill it in. |

## 12. Doc drift detection

`/doc-sync` keeps this repo honest about the docs it mirrors. Press **Sync docs now** (on the landing page or on `/doc-sync`) and it fetches the markdown source behind all 9 tracked doc pages, diffs each against the copy stored in `doc-snapshot/`, replaces that copy, and reports what moved — ranked by whether the change can actually break an implementation.

Doc pages are fetched by appending `.md` to their URL, which returns the authored MDX rather than the rendered HTML. Every response is checked for `text/markdown` before it is allowed near the snapshot: a URL that misses the markdown handler still answers `200` with the HTML app shell, and writing that in would destroy the baseline. A run commits all pages or none.

**Severity is decided by where the edit landed**, not how big it was:

| Level | Trigger |
|---|---|
| **High** | a changed line inside a fenced code block, a changed fence count, or a page that now 404s and is gone from the sitemap |
| **Medium** | a changed heading, changed frontmatter `title`/`description`, or prose in the same section as changed code |
| **Low** | other prose |

**Sections checked** lists every tracked page in nav order with a mark — `✓` unchanged, `!` changed, `+` stored, `✗` 404, `~` unstable, `·` not checked. Expanding a row shows the comparison: for a changed page the diff (`−` existing snapshot, `+` newly fetched), and for an unchanged one the two matching hashes, which is the evidence the check ran.

**`doc-snapshot/CHANGELOG.md`** is the record that survives a re-sync. Because syncing replaces the copy it just compared against, the run *after* a change reports nothing — so the changelog is written at the moment of discovery and never rewritten later. Only changed pages are recorded; a clean run does not touch the file. It keeps the three most recent dated entries, counted rather than aged.

**One sync date.** `syncedAt` in `doc-snapshot/manifest.json`, rewritten on every run. There is no hand-maintained date to keep in step with it.

### How it is wired on Angular

Angular has no server-action equivalent, so the boundary is plain HTTP. Everything that fetches docs or touches the snapshot lives in `frontend/src/app/lib/doc-sync/` and is imported **only** from `frontend/src/server.ts`, which exposes two endpoints:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/doc-sync` | current manifest summary + the latest report |
| `POST /api/doc-sync/run` | runs the sync, returns the result |

They sit on the SSR server rather than the Copilot Runtime because that is the Angular app's own server: `ng serve` routes through it in development (`ssr.entry` in `angular.json`) and it ships in `dist/`, so the button works in both without a second process. The browser half is `DocSyncClient`, a root-provided service holding signals — nothing in the browser bundle imports `node:fs`, which the build verifies by never resolving those modules into `dist/browser`.

**To test it**, edit any `doc-snapshot/pages/*.md` file and press the button — a line inside a code fence for High, a `##` heading for Medium, a sentence for Low. The comparison reads the stored file itself, so nothing else needs changing. Both `/doc-sync` and the changelog label the result as a local snapshot edit rather than upstream drift.

Commit `doc-snapshot/` — `pages/`, `manifest.json` and `CHANGELOG.md` are the baseline every diff is taken against. `reports/` is gitignored.

```

The nav, every route header, the demo links, and the status table all derive from `frontend/src/app/lib/nav-config.ts`, so a route's status is stated once.

**`features/` vs everything else.** Files under `features/` are doc code, kept as published — including where that conflicts with `frontend/AGENTS.md` (several set `changeDetection: OnPush` explicitly, which AGENTS.md says to omit on v22+). Every deviation from a published snippet is called out in the file's header comment. Everything outside `features/` is this harness's own code and follows AGENTS.md.
